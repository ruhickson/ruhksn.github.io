# Found Footage Challenge

In the spirit of getting back into blogging, I'm presenting myself with a challenge of watching 10 Found Footage films I've yet to see between now and Halloween. There are 20 weeks, so a fortnightly watch with a couple of hundred words' worth of a review is the target. The films are chosen by my brother, Bob, who has suggested (in no particular order):

- [Quarantined](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082868/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [`[REC]`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1)
- [`[REC2]`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245112/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)
- [`[REC3]`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1649444/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Found Footage 3D](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3449006/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_6)
- [The Poughkeepsie Tapes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010271/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Grave Encounters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1703199/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [Alien Abduction](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2510434/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [V/H/S 94](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14867006/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_6)
- [Afflicted](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2309961/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

The list isn't without quirks. I'd call myself a found footage buff, but I haven't seen several of these which I know are considered core pieces of the genre. Also, Quarantine is a remake of the first Rec film, so there's a little bit of doubling up, but hey, it wouldn't be the first time I rewatched a found footage film. Challenge starts this week, after I watch [Ghostwatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200659/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) for the first time...
